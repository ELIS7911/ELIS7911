#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm FullStack Developer. I'm trained in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Vue.Js, React, Redux, NodeJs, Express, PosgresSQL, Python y Django. I'm a person who takes on new challenges and works hard to overcome them. I'm strongly interested in developing my career in Front-End and Web-Design.

My experience has been mainly in design, since I am also an Architect and have worked for years as independent professional and university teacher. I am currently taking my last steps within Henry's Bootcamp, but IÂ´m sure that they will be the first in this new path in which I will be able to deploy all the problem solving skills that I have been developing throughout this time.

If you are interested in knowing more, please contact me and I'll give you an answer as soon as possible.
